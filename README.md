# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis
End-to-end hotel reservation data analysis using Power BI, including data cleaning, modeling, DAX measures, and interactive dashboarding. 

🏨 Hotel Reservation Analysis
This project was completed as part of my internship training at Imarticus Learning, where I analyzed hotel reservation data using Power BI.
The objective was to understand guest behavior, pricing patterns, booking trends, and cancellation risks to support better decision-making in the hotel industry.

This project helped me gain strong skills in data cleaning, DAX, Power BI dashboard design, and business storytelling.

⭐ Project Overview
The raw dataset included details about:

Guest demographics

Booking channels & market segments

Room types

Meal plans

Pricing (ADR)

Lead times

Special requests

Cancellations

Using Power BI, I transformed this dataset into an interactive analytical dashboard.


🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
✔ Removed duplicate rows and inconsistent entries
✔ Standardized formats (dates, categories, meal plans)
✔ Validated missing values for accuracy
✔ Converted raw fields into clean, usable dimensions
✔ Ensured high data quality before visualization


Hotel Reservation Analysis

📊 Key Insights & Visualizations
1. ADR (Average Daily Rate) by Month

Shows clear seasonal pricing patterns

Summer months have higher ADR

Helps adjust pricing strategies to maximize revenue

2. Revenue by Room Type

Standard rooms bring bulk bookings

Premium suites bring high-margin revenue

Helps optimize room mix & availability

3. Bookings by Market Segment

Leisure dominates weekends

Corporate bookings drive weekday demand

Group bookings spike during events
Strategic Benefit: Enables targeted marketing campaigns

4. Revenue by Market Segment

Corporate segment gives highest per-booking revenue

Helps prioritize high-value customer acquisition

5. Length of Stay & Meal Plan Insights

Average stay varies across guest types

Meal plan preferences reveal F&B revenue opportunities

Seasonal patterns help with staffing & resource planning

6. Heatmap – Day of Week vs Bookings

Weekends show high leisure bookings

Weekdays show strong business travel
Use Case: Design weekend packages & weekday business offers

7. Lead Time Analysis

Long lead time → leisure

Short lead time → business or last-minute
Benefit: Helps build cancellation policy & dynamic pricing

8. Cancellation Intelligence

~23% cancellation rate

$2.1M revenue at risk annually

Longer lead time leads to higher cancellation risk
Recommendation: Implement stronger cancellation rules & reminders

🧠 Skills Gained During Internship
